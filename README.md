## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, my goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, along with a detailed writeup of the project. 

Check out the [writeup PDF](https://github.com/kylemartin1/AdvancedLaneDetection/blob/master/Project4WriteUp.pdf) to learn how this algorithm works.
